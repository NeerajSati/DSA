/*
Given an array arr[] of size N representing the size of candles which reduce by 1 unit each day. The room is illuminated using the given N candles. Find the maximum number of days the room is without darkness.

 

Example 1:

Input: N = 3, arr[] = {1,1,2} 
Output: 2
Explanation: The candles' length reduce 
by 1 in 1 day. So, at the end of day 1: 
Sizes would be 0 0 1, So, at end of 
day 2: Sizes would be 0 0 0. This means 
the room was illuminated for 2 days.
